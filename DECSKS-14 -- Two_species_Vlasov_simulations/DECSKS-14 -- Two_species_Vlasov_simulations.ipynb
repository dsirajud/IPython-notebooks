    "We cast the Vlasov equations for both species in terms of set of common normalized variables. The normalizations are chosen according to characteristic scales of the plasma species which requires the most resolution so that the increments of time, length, and velocity in the numerical simulation suit the dynamics without having to partition the mesh quantities into unreasonably small fractions (that beyond inconvenience, can easily challenge machine precision). Here, the relevant scales are fixed by the characteristic electric field length, i.e. the Debye length, peculiar velocities will be traded for velocities relative to an average (thermal) velocity of the more mobile species (electrons), and the time measurements will be measured as multiples of the plasma period (time to traverse one circuit of the inertial (Debye) length)."

    "## B.3 Consequences of have two different grid resolutions for ions and electrons\n",
    "\n",
    "In any simulation, it is necessary to have the same configuration domain extents: $x\\in \\mathcal{D}_x$; however we are free to choose the number of gridpoints needed. Since electronic length scales are shorter than the characteristic ionic length scales, we may for example choose to have $(N_x)_{f_i} > (N_x)_{f_e}$ since the ions are significantly colder and move much smaller distances as compared to electrons in the same time step. While it is clear the configuration domain need to be equal so that physically we have electrons and ions occupying the same space, it is clear that they in general populate different regions of the overall phase sapce becuase of the large differences in velocity values taken between them. Thus, we do not require the same velocity domains. In fact, we should restrict the domain if we can in order to not waste storage and simulation expense. Thus, we may choose for example the electron velocity grid as $v_e\\in [-V_e, V_e]$, whereas the ion velocities may lie within $v_i\\in [-V_i, V_i]$ (neither need be symmetric, this is just an example) wehre $V_i \\neq V_e$. In general, there is also no consequence in having the grid points being different as well. For example, a coarser ion velocity mesh might be desired compared to the electron velocity grid ($(N_v)_{f_e} > (N_v)_{f_i}$ if ionzation physics is included. This is because of the important role of resolving the ionzation contribution from the high energy tail of electrons as compared to the slower ions (the largest source of ionzation is from electron-neutral collisions), hence we require adequately resolving the high energy tail with more grid points. For example, an isotropic production rate $K_{iz}$ over unit volume $[\\mathrm{L^3 / s}]$ is represented as [2]:\n",

    "$$K_{iz} = \\frac{\\int_{4\\pi} d\\Omega \\int_{v_{iz}}^{\\infty} dv v^2 (v\\sigma_{iz}(v) f_e(v))}{\\int d^3 x \\int d^3 v f_e(x,v)} \\sim \\frac{1}{n_e} \\int_{v_{ix}}^{\\infty} dv \\, v^3 f_e(v) \\sigma_{iz}(v)$$\n",

It is easy to overestimate or underestimate the number of ions borne from impact collisions if the mesh is not sufficiently resolved, it depends on the shape of the cross-section.\n",
