    "We cast the Vlasov equations for both species in terms of set of common normalized variables. The normalizations are chosen according to characteristic scales of the plasma species which requires the most resolution so that the increments of time, length, and velocity in the numerical simulation evolve suit the dynamics without having to partition the mesh quantities into unreasonably small fractions (that beyond inconvenience, can easily challenge machine precision). Here, the relevant scales are fixed by the characteristic electric field length, i.e. the Debye length, peculiar velocities will be traded for velocities relative to an average (thermal) velocity of the more mobile species (electrons), and the time measurements will be measured as multiples of the plasma period (time to traverse one circuit of the inertial (Debye) length).\n",
