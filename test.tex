$$\partial_t n_{\alpha} + \vec{\nabla}_x\cdot (n_{\alpha}\vec{V}) = S$$

Where $S$ is the moment of the source term in the inhomogeneous Vlasov equation (Boltzmann equation). Note, that for steady state analysis, we must include a source or else the plasma would be depleted as the species populations would be absorbed by the sink.

We now proceed with the anlaysis considering 1D and steady state. The above continuity equation becomes:

$$n\partial_x v_i + v_i \partial_x n = S$$

and consider the ion momentum equation (see boxed equation above for electrons, we take $-e \rightarrow e$ to recover the ion equation):

$$m_i nv_i \partial_x v_i = enE$$

In steady state, the electrons are to a good approximation adiabtic:

$$enE + T_e\partial_x n = 0 \Rightarrow enE = - T_e\partial_x n$$

Combining this with the ion momentum equation:

$$m_i nv_i \partial_x v_i = - T_e\partial_x n$$

Solving for the derivative of the density from the continuity equation: 

$$\partial_x n = \frac{1}{v_i}S - \frac{n}{v_i}\partial_x v_i$$
