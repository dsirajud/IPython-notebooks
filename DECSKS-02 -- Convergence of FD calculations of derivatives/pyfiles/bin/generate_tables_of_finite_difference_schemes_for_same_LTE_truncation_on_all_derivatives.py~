# generate_tables_of_finite_difference_schemes_for_same_LTE_truncation_on_all_derivatives.py
#
# This script generates two types of outputs (see __main__ routine at bottom):
#
#    (1) full summary of all families of explicit finite differences schemes
#        for all derivatives specified at given LTE
#
#    (2) individual files for each derivative which contains each family of
#        schemes (e.g. 'forward', 'backward', 'central') with varying degrees
#        of asymmetry.
#
#    *** (1) is generated as a presentable table that can be viewed by the user
#
#   default filepath:
#   ./DECSKS/etc/finite_difference_schemes/Tables_of_finite_difference_schemes_at_const_LTE.dat
#
#    *** (2) is generated in a particular format that a read function knows about
#            so that the tables of [weights, stencil] can be read into and stored
#            in a dictionary FD_schemes in store_schemes(dn_max)
#
#   default filepaths for (2):
#   ./DECSKS/etc/finite_difference_schemes/f1_FD_coefficients.dat
#   ./DECSKS/etc/finite_difference_schemes/f2_FD_coefficients.dat
#   , etc., one for each dn-th derivative dnf
#
#
# Quickstart:
#
# the script takes in a system arguments corresponding to the order of the
# LTE truncation error desired on the derivatives and the number of derivatives
# desired N, i.e. N = 4 generates derivatives dn = 1, 2, 3, 4
#
# $ python generate_table_of_finite_difference_schemes_required_for_same_LTE_truncation_on_all_derivatives LTE N
#
# where, LTE and N are both integers
#
# see __main__ routine below for execution details
