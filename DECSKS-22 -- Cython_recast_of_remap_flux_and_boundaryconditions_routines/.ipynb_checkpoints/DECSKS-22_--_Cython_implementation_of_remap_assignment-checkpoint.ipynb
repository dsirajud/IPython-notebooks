    "\n",
    "This notebook recasts the version of DECSKS-21 which created separate convect routines for velocity and configuration variables as well as furnished pre-computing the CFL numbers/correctors c at the start of the time step rather than recomputing it each time for configuration variables, which always use the same set of corrects c for a stage s upon each full time step. This noteboook creates Cython modules for some of the more problematic methods, boundaryconditions.py ->< boundaryconditions.pyx, flux.py --> flux.pyx, and takes convect_XXXXXX.remap_assignment -> remap.pyx module. Of course, corresponding changes inside the lib.convect_XXXXXX routines were needed, and have been accomplished in this notebook. The version in this notebook is extended in DECSKS-18 part 3 (note that DECSKS-18 part 2 was still using numpy-based implementations, i.e. the same skeleton created from DECSKS-09, which recorded the development of DECSKS-2.0, the array-based implementation)."

    "<code>advanced indexing</code> relies on indexing by taking in arrays of indices that is furnished by numpy built-ins to slice the indexing in the expected way, and a further layer is that it ignores masked entries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, we map according to:\n",
    "\n",
    "        f_k[xpostpointmesh, vxprepointmesh] = f_old[xprepointmesh, vxprepointmesh]\n",

    "The left hand side takes as indices the postpoint mesh, which maps each <code>[i,j]</code> on the right-hand side to postpositions <code>[k1,j]</code> or <code>[k2, j]</code> (incidentally, above we have written it redundantly for clarity, but do note that <code>f_old[xprepointmesh, vxprepointmesh] = f_old</code>, as the just slices <code>[i,j]</code> in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out, using this implementation where we rely on numpy advanced indexing: two or more postpoints cannot be shared, a given postpoint will get overwritten by the next one that has the same postpoint. This is due to how indices are read in and stored at the C level in numpy (row major ordering convention used in storing multidimensional arrays in equivalent 1D blocks of contiguous memory). Note, it is not possible to insert an increment operator inside this operation as it is not accessible at the python level. We have exploited the fact that previous boundary conditions have created the situation or can be made to create the situation where no two postpionts are shared. If this situation happens or can be created with minimial expense, then significant efficiency can be inherited by doing the remapping in \"one step\".\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have been adding more boundary conditions, the fortune of just having unique postpoints has not been a given, and some manipulations (often esoteric, at times clever) has been needed to achieve the required effect of the boundary conditions while also insisting on unique postpoints that do not cause unintended mappings in the one step remap.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our latest case of a symmetry boundary condition, several tactics have been attempted to achieve the same as above where a set of unique postpoints are decided on that in general will not conflict with the boundary conditions so that we may reuse our algorithm. The most promising strategy had been partitioning the problem into two separate remappings (partners vs. non-partners). In the end of our efforts, this was seen to be either wasteful storage-wise, or a looping implementation was unavoidable, which in the worst case scenario makes the symmetry boundary condition perhaps 100 times slower than the numpy based remap (avoiding a looping mechanism was the reason for working out how a one-step matrix mapping can be used instead).\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, it is has alwyas been noted that the current remapping procedure is esoteric, perhaps difficult for others besides the author to follow. And, because of this unique demand of having unique postpoints, it makes extending to different boundary conditions more involved, and unnatural. The efficiency that we have exploited unfortunately comes with too much baggage. <font color = \"purple\">The goal of this notebook is to dispense of this routine, and code an equivalent method that is natural, obvious, but still efficient.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Invariably, this will require the remap algorithm to take on the aforementioned evil looping mechanism where we loop through each prepoint and assigning it to a postpoint location incrementally. Going back to the C-level will permit us to do what was stated as a problem above. That is, we can \"insert\" an incremental operator instead of an assignment operator, so that overlapping postpoints have their densities added on top of each other, not having one overwrite the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be accomplished by coding the routines in Cython using typed ndarrays. We note that, if successful, it can invite reconsidering the boundary condition application above and overall control flow. As concerns the former, if efficiency makes it of negligible cost for example, in an absorbing or charge collecting boundary condition, we might assign all such postpoints that hit the walls (i < 0) to have the x postpoint corresponding to the wall (i = 0), which is physically appealing. In the past, we had skipped this unnecessary reassignment, and just zeroed out all such entires whose postpoints go off-grid. If we had a charge collecting surface, then we could sum all particles at i = 0, rather than as we do now where we sum all postpoints i < 0 if the left wall is charge collecting. The difference here is an \"extra\" step, and the benefit is straight-forwardness and readability to other users than just this author, easy adapation even and obvious extensions to other boundary conditions. If the cost of incuding an extra step like this is small, we should pursue such things. Since we are now reconsidering the overall architecture of the remap step, it is opportune to consider things now rather than later."

Instead of checking each column's velocity sign and applying the remap rule required, we instead extracted all negative CFL columns and non-negative velocity columns, then apply the remap rule to the array with all negative CFL once, and then the other remap rule to the other array with only non-negative CFL affiliation.

The conversion should take appreciable time such that we anticipate (and do not care to investigate) that the actual use of the above code where we used native C types and its associated conversions to and from <code>PyObject</code> to C types and back again would approach the Cython performance. Hence, we see Cython permits accessing C like speeds (as experience has told us before this), though we acknowledge this does not use a 2D C array, but a Python array with static typing for fast indexing."

As an example, we compared a simulation of DECSKS-2.0 with charge collecting on both edges of the domain on LF2 splitting, Nx = 240, Nvx = 400, Nt = 500 with DECSKS-2.1 which uses the above Cython routines, and we saw savings from taking approximately 2.1 seconds per time step in DECSKS-2.0 to taking ~ 0.6 seconds per time step in DECSKS-2.1."

    "Our original goal was to obtain comparable speeds by using more obvious implementations such as looping so that we removed a very particular requirement on DECSKS-2.0, which was that it relied on there being zero shared postpoints in a given time substep of advecting density packets. Here, we have recasted the code so that more obvious, physically intuitive, looping mechanisms have been used which not only removes this awkward requirement on shared postpoints, but incidentally is significantly more efficient than the previous version. Now that the requirement of shared postpoints is removed, we may go back and finish out details of handling the symmetry boundary condition. Which hitherto, had been plagued by this problem of being unable to produce unique postpoints in an efficient way. This is no longer a problem, so we may proceed forward by working out the details and coding it directly in DECSKS-18 part 3. <b>DECSKS-18 part 3 notebook contains this version developed here and extends it</b>"
