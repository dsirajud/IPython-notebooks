    "# DECSKS-XX: The potential of a plasma bound between two biased walls\n",
    "\n",
    "[<font color = \"magenta\">This notebook has been put on hold until Coulomb collisions have been included in DECSKS. It was realized such a system (bounded on both ends) cannot produce a steady state. Reassuringly, collisionless sheath analysis can be done, but we must (for example) consider different boundaries. One workable route is to have one end be an absorber, and to have the other end be a \"bulk plasma\" source. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the inconsistency present for for collisionless plasmas having a steady state when bounded by two walls, we quote Birsdall et. al [2, p.3192]:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"[The aforementioned simulations made a Boltzmann relation assumption on the electron distribution]. This is done to prevent an important inconsistency from arising in the analysis of the static potential profile [here, he means the steady state profile]. Consider the one-dimensional system of a symmetrical plasma bounded on both ends by conducting walls, which are not grounded (see Fig. 1). If the potential that results is monotonically decreasing between the center of the plasma and the walls, then all the injected ions are accelerated into the walls, while a certain fraction of the injected electrons are repelled by the collector sheath at each wall and are therefore trapped in the system. The velocity distribution function of the electrons that have bounced off the collector sheaths more than once will be truncated or cut off in both directions, since some of the injected electrons were energetic enough to traverse the collector sheaths and strike the walls. If the potential profile is static (i.e. no fluctuations in time), then the electrons cutoff velocity is likewise static in nature. For a truly collisionless, time-independent plasma, there is no mechanism present in the system that will repopulate the tail of the trapped electron distribution function. Therefore, it is not possible to maintain an equilibrium density of electrons, since the fraction of trapped electrons in the system will grow as more particles are injected. The ion density, however, will remain constant for a static potential profile. Herein lies the inconsistency of the collisionless assumption, since a constant ion density and a time-varying electron density implies a potential that changes with time. Each equilibrium, collisionless, bounded plasma model must there have some approximation that allows a constant electron density to be maintained.</font>]\n",
