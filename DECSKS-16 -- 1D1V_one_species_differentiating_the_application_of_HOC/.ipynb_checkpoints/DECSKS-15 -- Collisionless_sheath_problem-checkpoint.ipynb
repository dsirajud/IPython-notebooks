    "We regard the formation of a positive space charge within several Debye lengths of the boundary (\"edge\", $n_i > n_e$). A fluid analysis produces the criterion that the ion velocity entering the \"sheath\" are accelerated to the sound speed ($v_{i,se} = c_i$). By considering the dynamics from the bulk plasma looking towards the edge ($\\ell_{\\nabla} \\gg 1$), and from the edge looking outboard ($\\ell_{\\nabla} \\ll 1$), the solutions for both scales are matched in a limit sense requiring not an inequality, but an equality. In practice, the rough agreement that ions enter the sheath supersonically is commonly observed within margin. The criterion has gained momentum over the years to be accepted as a rule-of-thumb regarding the nonlinear sheath physics. More dangerously, the Bohm criterion has become accepted to the point where shortcuts in simulations are afforded by including it as a \"boundary condition\" when simulating the edge. The convenience is clear, requiring supersonic velocities of ions at the sheath boundary of a simulation domain saves significant computational expense of the complicated presheath physics in order to (what is hoped) to arrive at this same result (the Bohm criterion). The sticking issue that this practice is often done yet it is acknowledged that the Bohm criterion appears to be less tenable than it was at its inception. It is necesary to create a kinetic sheath in simulation order to see how well this criterion is upheld. And, it will be seen that even this generalized Bohm criterion shows fundamental vulnerabilities in that it restricts the classes of distributions that should give rise to sheaths due to a singularity present at zero velocity should the distribution be nonempty at this value."

This also broadens the transition region and obscures how to define a clean \"sheath edge\" for the plasma. It is clear that in real plasmas, if we track the point of immediate departure from quasineutrality $n_i \\simeq n_e$, this point tends to always correspond significantly inboard from the wall, much further than one would normally interpret in a $n$ vs. $x$ plot as what appears to be the sheath edge. Different conventions can be adopted that are more observationally consistent, e.g. the $x$ coordinate where we have a deviation by 1%, or perhaps 10% can be considered.

This region needs to be much wider than the sheath region so that it can accelerate the majority of ions at very different initial speeds to the the sound speed. This region is called the <i>presheath</i>. It is a region over which the ions transition to supersonic speeds largely unimpeded so they have enough distance to ramp up their velocity (collisionless), and at which point (sheath entrance) the condition of charge neutrality no longer holds since the electrons are quickly lost to the sink leaving a surplus of ions."

    "## A.3 Note about controversy\n",

    "\n",
    "#### on the original Bohm criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "There is significant discussion about the claimed interpretation of the Bohm criterion as well as the tacit conditions that must be made in order to obtain his result. Bohm acknowleges this in his principal paper, though does not put the words much specificity about what is off about both the stepthrough and the resulting interpretation. Actually, it is not until the final sentence that he puts forth the interpretation widely used (read: abused) in plasma physics explanations. Bohm claims the criterion, though obtained through uncareful means seems to hold in most experimental situations within \"rough[ly] 20%\", i.e. that the ions do enter the sheath within the sound velocity. Thus, it is expected that a guideline like this criterion not be considered too critically, especially given it is difficult to determine where exactly in the plasma bulk-edge transition region the criterion should be met.\n",
    "\n",
    "His final sentence reads: \"Thus, it may be said roughly that a sheath begins when $V_0 = kT_e /2e$ [$V$ is the potential], remembering that this means that beyond this point the potential begins to climb rapidly and the electron density to drop very rapidly.” There are no observations that deny that this does happen with the species populations, it is the definition of a sheath edge and the climbing of the potential that does not actually follow from what Bohm obtained. To that end, this author agrees with several others in that Bohm misinterpreted his result. His solution corresponds to an asymptotic solution, whose level curve at $v_i = c_s$ (sound speed) in the natural Hamiltonian phase space ($E$, $\\phi$) corresponds to an unstable manifold. Indeed, Bohm obtains a solution corresponding to the sheat being located in the limit $x\\rightarrow -\\infty$. He misinterprets the matching point of the two-scale analysis (bulk plasma vs. edge plasma) as being identical to the point where $V = V_0$, a reference point where $E = 0$. This isn't technically true, and can be shown straightforwardly that it deviates from this point in phase space ($E$, $\\phi$) in general [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### on the kinetic Bohm criterion [cf. Hegna, Callen back-and-forth in IEEE]\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown above in section A.2, a necessary step for the kinetic criterion to be obtained is the division by a velocity parallel to the electric field (above, $v_{x_i}$). The singularities that persist have no means to be removed, so this requires that the distribution function $f_i(v_{x_i} = 0) = 0$, otherwise the right-hand side diverges at the origin in phase space, and the left-hand side integrates to a quantity proportional to the temperature normalized by a density, which clearly cannot be zero. A second thought rationalization is thet this then requires in the sheath region that there exist only one-sided velocities on the ion distribution. This is reassuring given it is the expectation in this region. If any ion escapes (threshold at $f_i(v_{x_i} \\leq 0$), then this is not the sheath region. However, it is not satisfying that even basic distributions such as Maxwellian ions cannot be captured by this criterion. There is other issue that some authors contest with this rationalization as well (e.g. the kinetic description takes a continuum limit so that $\\lambda_D / L \\rightarrow 0$ so the sheath is infinitely thin), but as concerns the present purposes, it is sufficient to close the controversy survey here given all the main points have been outlined. One bottom line is that the kinetic criterion because of its divergenceless requirement makes the criterion experimentally untestable. The nonlinear Vlasov solver DECSKS-2.0 will provide a check on this criterion, we will see where this condition is of help, thus locating the \"sheath edge.\" "

The requirement that is needed to establish a sheath is the absorbing boundary ($f_e(x = x_{w}, v_{x,outgoing}) = 0$, where $x_w < 0$ is the location of the absorbing wall. The electrons \"escape\" from the system on one end, leaving only positive charges. The wall should be permitted to charge up according to the electron fluxes hitting the wall. This provides a feedback into the system so that less energetic electrons will be repelled and the positive space charge can be developed.
