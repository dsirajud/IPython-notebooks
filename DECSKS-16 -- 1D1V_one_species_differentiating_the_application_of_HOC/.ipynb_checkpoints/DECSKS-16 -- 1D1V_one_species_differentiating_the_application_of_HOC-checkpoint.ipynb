    "Currently, the manner in which high order corrections are applied is supplied as a single option in the input file etc/params.dat. This notebook records the short goal of just adding in the funcationality/option so that different high order corrections (HOC) methods can be applied to different phase space variables. The reason for this upgrade is that the velocity boundary conditions are always periodic, so it makes sense to use the globally accurate Fourier corrections to find the high order corrections which outperform finite differences in accuracy.\n",
