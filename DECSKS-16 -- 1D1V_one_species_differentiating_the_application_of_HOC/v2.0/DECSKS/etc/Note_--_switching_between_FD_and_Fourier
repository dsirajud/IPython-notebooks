To switch between FD and Fourier

If on FD, and want to switch to Fourier:

    x etc/params.dat change HOC (L1) to fourier

If on Fourier, and want to switch to FD:

    x etc/params.dat change high order correction mode (L1) to FD

    x etc/params.dat choose order of accuracy (L2), N

    x Generate finite difference weights and stencils needed by running the script

        $ python generate_finite_difference_schemes_required_for_a_chosen_GE_on_CS.py N

    where N (int) should be replaced with the same value as in the previous step

    x lib/read.py uncomment out sim_params entry pertaining to FD_schemes

    x /main.py uncomment out sim_params['W'] line that assembles FD weight matrix
