Even in the extreme case where all particles from $f$ exit the domain as all particles from $f^C$ enter, we will not be computing parameters for the \"full grid\" evenstill. The fluxes from $f$ will be zeroed out, and only the complement fluxes will be computed. Thus, the savings in computational cost is still clear."
