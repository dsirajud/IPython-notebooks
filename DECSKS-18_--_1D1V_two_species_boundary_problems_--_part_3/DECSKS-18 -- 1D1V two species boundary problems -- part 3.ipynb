    "A numerical condition can be used to reduce the simulated domain in half provided there is symmetry that can be exploited. Suppose the situation is that there are two walls at a distance $x = \\pm L$ from a center $x = 0$ with identical boundary conditions at either edge $x = \\pm L$. Instead of simulating the full domain $x\\in [-L,L]$ , and enforcing the two boundary conditions at each wall ($x = \\pm L$), we can simulate the domain $x\\in [0, L]$ where we replace the wall condition at $x = -L$ with a <i>symmetry boundary condition</i> at $x = 0$. <font color = \"magenta\">We henceforth refer to this simulated domain $\\mathcal{D}_x = [0,L]$ as simply the <i>domain</i>, and we refer to the unsimulated domain $[-L, 0]$ as a <i>complement domain</i> $\\mathcal{D}_x^C$</font>. A symmetry boundary condition communicates the effect of the density in the complement domain to the simulated domain so that simulating the domain with this condition gives a full picture of the \"both sides\" ($[-L,0]$ and $[0,L]$) as the interaction is factored in consistently.
