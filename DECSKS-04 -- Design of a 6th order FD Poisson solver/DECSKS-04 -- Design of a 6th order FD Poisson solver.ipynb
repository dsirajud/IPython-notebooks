    "For non-open (closed or semi-open) systems, the boundaries break the periodicity and force our hand to consider alternate forms of computing the derivatives, the most obvious candidate being finite difference schemes. In a previous notebook (\"Generation of families of explicit finite difference schemes for derivatives of any order of chosen LTE\"), the details of obtaining arbitrary order accuracy estimates as explict finite differences for any order derivative with any degree of sidedness (e.g. centered, forward, all forward but one point backward, etc.) were worked through. The conclusions were coded into a series of scripts which compute explicit finite difference coefficient tables for the family of schemes for any derivative for user queried LTEs. In the context of DECSKS, these FD tables are used to compute the high order flux corrections to an evolving density that are employed in the remap step. In <code>DECSKS.lib.read</code> we read in the generated files for this particular application where we sample only on-grid points and do not restrict ourselves to the big three types: forward, centered, or backward differencing, but instead strive for mainintaing as centered a stencil as possible, as these give better representations of the function and thus its derivatives than sampling only one side. That application aside, we can also use the coded scripts to discern FD coefficients for any derivative for stencils of any degree of sidedness for any order of accuracy, which is where we find their use in this notebook as we will require high order finite difference coefficients for various derivatives with varying degrees of sidedness in their stencils.\n",
    "\n",
    "We confess at the outset that we do not have motivation to pursue Poisson solvers of too high order, because finite difference based corrections on DECSKS cannot succeed when we get too high (greater than LTE order 10 or so). That is, recall in the notebook <a href = \"../DECSKS-03%20--%20Convergence%20of%20FD%20formulation%20of%20high%20order%20CS/DECSKS-03%20--Convergence%20of%20FD%20formulation%20of%20high%20order%20CS.ipynb\">Convergence of FD formulation of high order CS</a>. There, our pursuit of higher order was shown to not be achievable after a certain point as edge effects precluded higher accuracy. This was shown convincingly to be a consequence of the finite differenced derivatives being unable to converge near the edges (a consequence of the limited information available when at an edge we difference from one side more than the other). Thus, we note our provisional limit in the phase space remapping assignment is perhaps LTE order $O(\\Delta z^{10})$, $z = \\{x,v\\}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When addressing more involved physics (e.g. Vlasov, just below), the accuracy of our solution will <i>not</i> be controlled by the order of the CS solver incidentally, but ultimately by the choice of what is ultimately an expensive and lower order time splitting scheme used in the numerical stepthrough (e.g. time splitting schemes of LTE orders 3, 5, 7 are within the means of serial processing; however, pushing for more accurate schemes is both too intensive at this juncture, and it is unclear what a motivating context or test problem would need higher order), so we are not discouraged in the slightest. What we desire is a phase space remapping of an order $O(\\Delta z^{N+1})$ LTE that is high enough to not further pollute the solution with respect to the limitations of the time splitting procedure, which scales with LTEs of order $O(\\Delta t^3)$, $O(\\Delta t^5)$, $O(\\Delta t^7)$, $\\ldots$. Since the CFL numbers are not constant, there is no obvious relationship between the mesh spacing $\\Delta z$ and the time grid spacing $\\Delta t$. \n",

    "<i>(We also point out to the reader that we never say \"order\" on its own as this is ambiguous and language is used both undiligently and inconsistently in literature (whether an \"order $N$\" method means \"correct up to order $N$\" (LTE order = $N+1$), or if someone means an \"order $N$\" method means the LTE is order $N$). Note, that we always say \"LTE order\" or \"global error of order,\" or some variation in order to specify what it is we are speaking of. In this way, the point of bringing this to the reader's attention is that time splitting literature tends to favor labelling methods as $N$th order if they have an LTE of $N+1$ (i.e. the method is termed with the notion that it is correct <i>up to and including order $N$</i>), which is opposite to the preference in most PDE solver literature (an $N$th order method means the LTE itself is of order $N$, i.e. is correct <i>up to and including order $N-1$</i>). In this way, for the popular time splitting leapfrog scheme, it is often abbreviated as LF2, with mention that it is 2nd order, but this means its LTE is order 3. This is the opposite of how we speak of PDE solvers, e.g. a solver being of \"order\" 3 means the LTE is of order 3 in most publishings. Thus, it should be understood there is no conflict with the above LTEs reported for time splitting, e.g. Yoshida 4, aka Y4, has an LTE order of 5, because the convention used in its definition is just incompatible with the PDE solver literature norm. In order to not rely on the reader to \"know\" this common confusion, we make note that we will always specify LTE or GE (global error) when talking of \"order.\"</i>\n",

    "<li> <u>If there is no PDE</u>: and we consider the pure math problem of raising the LTE of the second derivative then the only manner in which the FD estimate of $\\partial_x^2\\phi (x_i)$ can be increased to higher order is by considering expanding $\\phi (t, x_{i + k})$ for several other $k\\in\\mathbb{Z}$. Doing so, we develop a set of equations, that upon manipulation we have the latitude needed to eliminate orders by Gaussian elimination. This can be repeated for more points, and the algebra can be done so that higher and higher orders are killed off so that we achieve an overall highier LTE. Necessarily, this expands the stencil $\\{k\\}$ of the FD scheme. Such schemes are called explicit. Alternatively, the same result is obtained in recognition that linear combination of derivatives (expressed in terms of differences among the $\\{\\phi (x_{i+k})\\}$ is ultimately what cancels high order terms.

In this way, we Taylor expand the left-hand sides after this statement has already been assembled, and construct order requirements that each order up to but not including the order $M$ vanish. This produces enough equations to solve for the equations uniquely in the explicit case.

Implicit schemes are computational more expensive than explicit, hence we do not consider this at the juncture, though later investigations may provide motivation to return to this issue given restricting the stencil size is a admittedly desirable.

Thus, for the differencing of $n$ we require using a 'forward-1' scheme, which samples grid points totally forward of the point $i = 1$ and one backward $i = 0$ (hence the nomenclature which has been used in previous in notebooks in abbreviated form (i.e. equivalent to 'forward 1'). We use the following script to generate the family of schemes required for the requisite LTE on $n$ (recall we require $LTE[n_{e,i}^{(2)} = O(\\Delta x^4)$ and $LTE[n_{e,i}^{(4)}] = O(\\Delta x^2)$)"

    "Thus, the solve produces a periodic potential correct up to an additive constant. This is expected $\\lambda = 0$ is an eigenvalue and the solution expressed in terms of its eigenbasis $\\phi \\sim \\sum_k v_k e^{\\lambda_k x}$ necessarily has an offset term at $\\lambda_k = 0$ whose value is not uniquely enforced in the above through any boundary value, rather this value is only maintained to be equal to that of the other endpoint one period away from the other. Since this offset is unrestrained, the code chooses to center it about $\\phi = 0$ by subtracting out the average value over the evolved gridpoints $i = 0, 1, \\ldots , N-2$. Note, it is improper to subtract out the average over all gridpoints $i = 0, 1, \\ldots, N-1$, as the final node does not strictly belong to the periodic cell, but is shared with the imagined adjacent cell (a full period spans $i = 0,1, \\ldots , N -2$. That is, a periodic domain is extended over $(-\\infty , \\infty)$ by tesselating these cells and the period is $N - 1$ by construction, not $N$. This was a choice in the bookkeeping so that we can, for example, refer to $N$ nodes rather than $N+1$. The convention where $N+1$ nodes with period $N$ is also widely used throughout literature, perhaps even more often."

    "<b>Note</b>: it is obvious that the charge density $n_e - n_i$ must be consistent with the consequences of periodic boundary conditions on the potential. Failure to choose consistent densities $n_e$ and $n_i$ (e.g. choosing initial densities for the start of a simulation where they both evolve self-consistently) will cause the periodic BC solver to fail since, put in one way: subtracting out an \"average\" value does not center the density at zero so that integrating over $x$ does not give zero overall, but an offset persists, and the boundary conditions for $\\phi$ that are purported to be periodic contradict the actual charge densities which are incapable of producing such periodicity in $\\phi$.\n",

    "## G.1 General remarks on Neumann boundary condition (NBC) setup\n",
    "\n",
    "With the motivation that centered differences provide higher fidelity derivative estimates to smooth functions as compared to sided differences, we note at the edge we can stagger the stencil somewhat beyond the left edge ($i = 0$) to make it \"more\" centered; however, we cannot do this too much to make it completely centered; the more centered we make it the more off-grid (ghost) points in $\\phi_i$ ($i < 0$) are involved, which introduce extra unknowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "At most, it turns out to be possible to include one ghost point easily (but no more) at each boundary we have an NBC at, e.g. at the boundary $i = 0$, if we write the NBC involving the ghost point $i = -1$ ($\\phi_{-1}$), we can eliminate it by writing a statement of Poisson's equation centered at the gridpoint $i = 0$ (i.e. the LHS of $\\partial_x^2\\phi = n$ is $LHS \\sim \\phi_{-1} - 2\\phi_0 + \\phi_1$). Similarly if we had an NBC at the right edge $i = N-1$, we can involve the ghost point $\\phi_N$ in the statement of the NBC at $i = N-1$, and eliminate it by a statement of Poisson's equation at the grid point $N-1$ (i.e. the LHS of $\\partial_x^2\\phi = n$ is $LHS \\sim \\phi_{N-2} - 2\\phi_{N-1} + \\phi_{N}$). \n",
    "\n",
    "If we try to be even more centered by estimating the Neumann condition using more points on the left (e.g. $\\phi_{-2,}, \\phi_{-3}, \\ldots $), we do not have the required extra equations to eliminate these new unknowns so we emphasize again that the most centered we can be for differencing the Neumann condition without using extrapolation is an asymmetry by one grid point (forward-1 scheme for a left boundary or a backward+1 scheme for a right boundary) determine these values. \n",

Thus, since introducing a ghost point at either edge for $\\phi$ required an additional Poisson equation centered about each edge node, the RHS of such statements must be sided (differencing density at the $i= 0$ or $i = N-1$ Poisson equation with forward 0 scheme or backward 0 scheme, respectively).

    "Thus, in our test cases below we must mind this condition. The interpretation of this is most obvious in special cases, consider Laplace's equation where we have no source term, $\\Delta \\phi = \\vec{\\nabla}\\cdot \\vec{\\Gamma} = 0$ where the flux $\\vec{\\Gamma} = \\vec{\\nabla}\\phi$. More relatably, take the function $\\phi$ to be a temperature-like object, so that the object $\\vec{\\Gamma} = \\vec{\\nabla}\\phi$ is a heat-like flux. If the flux of the flux is zero ($\\vec{\\nabla}\\cdot\\vec{\\Gamma} = 0$), there is no heat-like flow, i.e. the system is at equilibrium (Laplace's equation is a PDE which gives the equilbrium distribution, is the heat equation with $\\partial_t\\rightarrow 0$).\n",

In Laplace's equation, the diffusion of the quantity $\\phi$ causes it to spread evenly so that it approaches a constant value $\\phi (t\\rightarrow \\infty, x) = c$; however, any such $c$ also satisfies Laplaces equations along with the boundary conditions. Thus, there are an infinity of solutions.\n",

This restricts the problems we can solve, i.e. must satisfy the solubility condition. This will permit us to generate one of the infinite number of solutions for such problems by our selection of the DBC in the Cauchy data set. In our plasma context, since what we are solving for is a potential and what determines the evolution of the plasma particles is a difference in potential, not absolute value, this workaround comes at no consequence and is seen to accomplish the goal nicely.\n",
