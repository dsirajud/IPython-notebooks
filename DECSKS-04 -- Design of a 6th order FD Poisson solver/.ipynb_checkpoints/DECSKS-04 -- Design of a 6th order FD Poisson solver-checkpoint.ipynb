    "For non-open (closed or semi-open) systems, the boundaries break the periodicity and force our hand to consider alternate forms of computing the derivatives, the most obvious candidate being finite difference schemes. In a previous notebook (\"Generation of families of explicit finite difference schemes for derivatives of any order of chosen LTE\"), a series of scripts were developed to compute explicit finite difference coefficient tables for the family of schemes for any derivative for user queried LTEs. These files can be read in and stored as a matrix which produces the derivative of the post-multiplied function that can be efficiently accomplished as a vectorized operation using NumPy arrays. Efforts were made to follow the maxim for the differencing to remain \"as centered as reasonably achievable\" (ACARA, H/T to the radiation dosimetry mnemonic, 'ALARA'), a principle that permits grid sampling for FD computations in the interior to be the most-centered scheme available whereas near the edge nodes the construction of the matrix employs schemes only with as much deviation from centered as is required to stay within the domain (see the aformentioned notebook for details). \n",

Recall, trying to pursue higher order is not achievable where the source of this problem was convincingly demonstrated to be an effect of the many FD derivatives required beyond this order failed to simultaneously converge for a given mesh (one or more fall into non-convergent zones, so the requisite LTE is not achieved). Thus, we note our provisional limit in the phase space remapping assignment is perhaps LTE order $O(\\Delta z^{10})$, $z = \\{x,v\\}$.  \n",

    "When addressing more involved physics (e.g. Vlasov, just below), the accuracy of our solution will <i>not</i> be controlled by the order of the CS solver incidentally, but ultimately by the choice of what is ultimately an expensive and lower order time splitting scheme used in the numerical stepthrough (e.g. time splitting schemes of LTE orders 3, 5, 7 are within the means of serial processing; however, pushing for more accurate schemes is both too intensive at this juncture, and it is unclear what a motivating context or test problem would need higher order), so we are not discouraged in the slightest. What we desire is a phase space remapping of an order $O(\\Delta z^{N+1})$ LTE that is high enough to not further pollute the solution with respect to the limitations of the time splitting procedure, which scales with LTEs of order $O(\\Delta t^3)$, $O(\\Delta t^5)$, $O(\\Delta t^7)$, $\\ldots$. Since the CFL numbers are not constant, there is no obvious relationship between the mesh spacing $\\Delta z$ and the time grid spacing $\\Delta t$. \n",

    "<i>(We also point out to the reader that we never say \"order\" on its own as this is ambiguous and language is used both undiligently and inconsistently in literature (whether an \"order $N$\" method means \"correct up to order $N$\" (LTE order = $N+1$), or if someone means an \"order $N$\" method means the LTE is order $N$). Note, that we always say \"LTE order\" or \"global error of order,\" or some variation in order to specify what it is we are speaking of. In this way, the point of bringing this to the reader's attention is that time splitting literature tends to favor labelling methods as $N$th order if they have an LTE of $N+1$ (i.e. the method is termed with the notion that it is correct <i>up to and including order $N$</i>), which is opposite to the preference in most PDE solver literature (an $N$th order method means the LTE itself is of order $N$, i.e. is correct <i>up to and including order $N-1$</i>). In this way, for the popular time splitting leapfrog scheme, it is often abbreviated as LF2, with mention that it is 2nd order, but this means its LTE is order 3. This is the opposite of how we speak of PDE solvers, e.g. a solver being of \"order\" 3 means the LTE is of order 3 in most publishings. Thus, it should be understood there is no conflict with the above LTEs reported for time splitting, e.g. Yoshida 4, aka Y4, has an LTE order of 5, because the convention used in its definition is just incompatible with the PDE solver literature norm. In order to not rely on the reader to \"know\" this common confusion, we make note that we will always specify LTE or GE (global error) when talking of \"order.\"</i>\n",

    "<li> <u>If there is no PDE</u>: and we consider the pure math problem of raising the LTE of the second derivative then the only manner in which the FD estimate of $\\partial_x^2\\phi (x_i)$ can be increased to higher order is by considering expanding $\\phi (t, x_{i + k})$ for several other $k\\in\\mathbb{Z}$. Doing so, we develop a set of equations, that upon manipulation we have the latitude needed to eliminate orders by Gaussian elimination. This can be repeated for more points, and the algebra can be done so that higher and higher orders are killed off so that we achieve an overall highier LTE. Necessarily, this expands the stencil $\\{k\\}$ of the FD scheme. Such schemes are called explicit. Alternatively, the same result is obtained in recognition that linear combination of derivatives (expressed in terms of differences among the $\\{\\phi (x_{i+k})\\}$ is ultimately what cancels high order terms.

In this way, we Taylor expand the left-hand sides after this statement has already been assembled, and construct order requirements that each order up to but not including the order $M$ vanish. This produces enough equations to solve for the equations uniquely in the explicit case.

Implicit schemes are computational more expensive than explicit, hence we do not consider this at the juncture, though later investigations may provide motivation to return to this issue given restricting the stencil size is a admittedly desirable.

Thus, for the differencing of $n$ we require using a 'forward-1' scheme, which samples grid points totally forward of the point $i = 1$ and one backward $i = 0$ (hence the nomenclature which has been used in previous in notebooks in abbreviated form (i.e. equivalent to 'forward 1'). We use the following script to generate the family of schemes required for the requisite LTE on $n$ (recall we require $LTE[n_{e,i}^{(2)} = O(\\Delta x^4)$ and $LTE[n_{e,i}^{(4)}] = O(\\Delta x^2)$)"

    "Thus, the solve produces a periodic potential correct up to an additive constant. This is expected $\\lambda = 0$ is an eigenvalue and the solution expressed in terms of its eigenbasis $\\phi \\sim \\sum_k v_k e^{\\lambda_k x}$ necessarily has an offset term at $\\lambda_k = 0$ whose value is not uniquely enforced in the above through any boundary value, rather this value is only maintained to be equal to that of the other endpoint one period away from the other. Since this offset is unrestrained, the code chooses to center it about $\\phi = 0$ by subtracting out the average value over the evolved gridpoints $i = 0, 1, \\ldots , N-2$. Note, it is improper to subtract out the average over all gridpoints $i = 0, 1, \\ldots, N-1$, as the final node does not strictly belong to the periodic cell, but is shared with the imagined adjacent cell (a full period spans $i = 0,1, \\ldots , N -2$. That is, a periodic domain is extended over $(-\\infty , \\infty)$ by tesselating these cells and the period is $N - 1$ by construction, not $N$. This was a choice in the bookkeeping so that we can, for example, refer to $N$ nodes rather than $N+1$. The convention where $N+1$ nodes with period $N$ is also widely used throughout literature, perhaps even more often."

The case for Dirichlet boundary conditions were considered and an implementation was designed for both a cold ion (constant) background density $n_i$ alongside the evolving electron density $n_e$ (i.e. $n = n_e - n_i$, the \"minus\" sign in Poisson's equation is already accounted for here)."
