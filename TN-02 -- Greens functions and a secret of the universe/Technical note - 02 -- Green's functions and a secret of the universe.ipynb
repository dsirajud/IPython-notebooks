    "In this note, we give a simple example per Osgood [1] where the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE) is seen to be a Fourier series whereafter we introduce some notation to make transparent that the solution of the PDE takes the general form of a convolution with a kernel (Green's function) with the initial data:\n",

    "\n",
    "where $G$ is the Green's function, $f(y) = u(x,0)$ is the initial data, and $u = u(x,t)$ is the solution to the partial differential equation. As Osgood suggests, the fact that in general the solution to a PDE takes this general form \"is kind of a secret of the universe [that I'm letting you in on].\" The motivation for this notebook is the author's observation that even among engineering graduate students, it is not unusual to be the only one in a room who actually knows what a Green's function is (same with Hamiltonians, action integrals, Lagrange multipliers and calculus of variations, but we save those for other notebooks!). Green's functions solutions is a powerful technique that should be more common knowledge than it is. It seems the notion of Green's functions is more supposed on the part of the instructor in graduate courses than it is lectured about, which creates a gap in education."

    "\n",
    "It was shown above that the solution to a PDE naturally took the form of a Fourier series, and that we may alternatively cast this solution as a convolution of the initial data with a kernel commonly called the Green's function for the problem. In this way, we obtained the form of the Green's function and identified it after the solution had already been found. There is not a use for doing that labelling aside from the education of seeing how a Green's function is present whether or not we pursued that technique or not. In practice, we are faced the problem of finding a solution to a PDE or ODE, and desire its solution. One way of doing this is motivated by the idea shown in Section C where if we had the Green's function, we could simply integrate eq. $(***)$, and be done. Thus, this inverse procedure is where we often find ourselves: needing the Green's function to find the solution $u$, rather than caring about knowing the solution $u$ and identifying the Green's function.\n",

    "The game is then played by employing integration by parts as many times as needed to interchange the differentiation from acting on $u$ to acting on $G$. In general, this produces boundary terms (i.e. in the statement $\\int u dv = uv|_{\\partial S} - \\int v du$, the term $uv|_{\\partial S}$ is a boundary term; in general the form of the boundary terms that appear have all to do with what $\\mathcal{L}$ looks like). Notwithstanding, the general result after this stepthrough is always of the following form:\n",
