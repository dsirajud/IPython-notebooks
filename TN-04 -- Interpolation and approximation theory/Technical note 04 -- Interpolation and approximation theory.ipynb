    "we quote the following for motivation: \"For every predefined table of interpolation nodes there is a continuous function for which the sequence of interpolation polynomials on those nodes diverges.[6] For every continuous function there is a table of nodes on which the interpolation process converges.[citation needed] Chebyshev interpolation (i.e., on Chebyshev nodes) converges uniformly for every absolutely continuous function.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, we seek a function $P(x)$ that interpolates a function $f$ of $x$ over a domain $\\mathcal{D}$ using representative sample points (nodes) $x_i$ in the domain which the function $P$ is designed to agree with exactly. That The approximation theory problem is to find such a function that minimizes a measure of the error, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\min_{x\\in\\mathcal{D}}||P(x) - f(x)||$$\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. if we wish to minimize the maximum error, we use the $L^{\\infty}$ norm to a small number $\\varepsilon$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\min_{x\\in\\mathcal{D}}\\left\\{ \\max_{x\\in\\mathcal{D}} |P(x) - f(x)|\\right\\} = \\varepsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a fundamental result of approximation theory that a polynomial, for example, of degree $N$, $P_N$ can interpolate $N+1$ points exactly. In the course of finding such a polynomial, an <b>optimal polynomial</b> of degree $N$, $P_N$, is such a function that can interpolate $N+1$ points and which is said to <b>level</b>, i.e. it's error curve oscillates betwen $\\pm \\varepsilon$, $\\varepsilon\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and has $N+2$ extrema. It this latter point that gives rise to <b>Runge's phenomenon</b>, a phenomenon whereby increasing the number of points (hence, the order of the polynomial $N$) on a uniformly spaced grid decreases the agreement with the actual function due to oscillating between the $N+2$ extrema. These tend to \"accumulate\" near the node edges, so that a ringing phenomenon is observed at the edges of the domain."
