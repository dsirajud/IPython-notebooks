    "# A. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The collisionless matrix sheath problem develops from the electrostatics influence on local plasma species populations in the vicinity of a sink (boundary). We regard the formation of a positive space charge within several Debye lengths of the boundary (\"edge\", $n_i > n_e$). A fluid analysis produces the criterion that the ion velocity entering the \"sheath\" are accelerated to the sound speed ($v_{i,se} = c_i$). By considering the dynamics from the bulk plasma looking towards the edge ($\\ell_{\\nabla} \\gg 1$), and from the edge looking outboard ($\\ell_{\\nabla} \\ll 1$), the solutions for both scales are matched per usual strategem requiring not an inequality, but an equality. In practice, the rough agreement that ions enter the sheath supersonically is commonly observed within margin. The criterion has gained momentum over the years to be accepted as a rule-of-thumb regarding the nonlinear sheath physics. More dangerously, the Bohm criterion has become accepted to the point where shortcuts in simulations are afforded by including it as a \"boundary condition\" when simulating the edge. The convenience is clear, requiring supersonic velocities of ions at the sheath boundary of a simulation domain saves significant computational expense of the complicated presheath physics in order to (what is hoped) to arrive at the same result (the Bohm criterion). The sticking issue that this practice is often done yet it is acknowledged that the Bohm criterion appears to be less tenable than it was at its inception. It is necesary to create a kinetic sheath in simulation order to see how well this criterion is upheld.\n",

    "The first term on the right-hand side $\\int_{V} d^3 v \\vec{\\nabla}_v\\cdot (\\vec{v}f_e) = \\int_{\\partial S} d^2\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{v}f_e \\rightarrow 0$ at $|v| \\rightarrow \\infty$. The second term is obvious, note that:\n",

    "\n",
    "It is convenient to rewrite the dyad in terms of the mean velocity $\\vec{V} = \\int d^3 v \\vec{v}f_e$, so that physical quantities (pressures) can be readily identified. For example:\n",

    "\n",
    "At this point, applying the derivatives on the left-hand sides causes the continuity equation to unfold naturally, which allows the removal of some terms given continuity implies both terms sum to zero. This achieves the form most frequently quoted as the <b>momentum equation</b>:\n",

    "Further, a partition of the pressure tensor is also convenient and clarifying:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{\\vec{P}} = p\\vec{\\vec{I}} + \\vec{\\vec{\\Pi}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the scalar pressure $p = \\frac{1}{3}\\text{Tr}(\\vec{\\vec{P}})$.  Note, the pressure tensor itself is a second rank symmetric tensor, thus the trace is invariant under orthonormal coordinate transformations, hence a scalar pressure of the same value independent of coordinate system can always be defined the same way. We often consider simpler circumstances, for example if the pressure is isotropic, then the viscosity tensor $\\vec{\\vec{\\Pi}}= \\vec{\\vec{0}}$. So, we reduce the pressure tensor in isotropic cases to be the following and its divergence accordingly becomes:\n",

An equation of state can also be asserted for our sufficiently regular circumstances: $p = n_eT_e$. In general, this fluid parameter (an average) is a function of the configuration variable $x$, here we are considering a limited case where the electrons respond only to electrostatic interactions. The electrons being sufficiently mobile respond rapidly to any local variations that develop and act quickly to regularize any charge deviations as best they can (effectively accomplished in the bulk [quasineutrality], partially accomplished in the thin edge region). Notwithstanding, the temperature gradient scale length is much larger than edge characteristic scale lengths. Hence an isothermal enforcement is appropriate, and not inaccurate in the thin edge.

It is clear that in real plasmas, if we track the point of immediate departure from quasineutrality $n_i \\simeq n_e$, this point tends to always correspond significantly inboard from the wall, much further than one would normally interpret in a $n$ vs. $x$ plot as what appears to be the sheath edge.

    "## A.3 Note about controversy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### on the original Bohm criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "There is significant discussion about the claimed interpretation of the Bohm criterion as well as the tacit conditions that must be made in order to obtain his result. Bohm acknowleges this in his principal paper, though does not put the words much specificity about what is off about both the stepthrough and the resulting interpretation. Actually, it is not until the final sentence that he puts forth the interpretation widely used (read: abused) in plasma physics explanations. Bohm claims the criterion, though obtained through uncareful means seems to hold in most experimental situations within \"rough[ly] 20%\", i.e. that the ions do enter the sheath within the sound velocity. Thus, it is expected that a guideline like this criterion not be considered too critically, especially given it is difficult to determine where exactly in the plasma bulk-edge transition region the criterion should be met.\n",
    "\n",
    "His final sentence reads: \"Thus, it may be said roughly that a sheath begins when $V_0 = kT_e /2e$ [$V$ is the potential], remembering that this means that beyond this point the potential begins to climb rapidly and the electron density to drop very rapidly.” There are no observations that deny that this does happen with the species populations, it is the definition of a sheath edge and the climbing of the potential that does not actually follow from what Bohm obtained. To that end, this author agrees with several others in that Bohm misinterpreted his result. His solution corresponds to an asymptotic solution, whose level curve at $v_i = c_s$ (sound speed) in the natural Hamiltonian phase space ($E$, $\\phi$) corresponds to an unstable manifold. Indeed, Bohm obtains a solution corresponding to the sheat being located in the limit $x\\rightarrow -\\infty$. He misinterprets the matching point of the two-scale analysis (bulk plasma vs. edge plasma) as being identical to the point where $V = V_0$, a reference point where $E = 0$. This isn't technically true, and can be shown straightforwardly that it deviates from this point in phase space ($E$, $\\phi$) in general [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### on the kinetic Bohm criterion [cf. Hegna, Callen back-and-forth in IEEE]\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown above in section A.2, a necessary step for the kinetic criterion to be obtained is the division by a velocity parallel to the electric field (above, $v_{x_i}$). The singularities that persist have no means to be removed, so this requires that the distribution function $f_i(v_{x_i} = 0) = 0$, otherwise the right-hand side diverges at the origin in phase space, and the left-hand side integrates to a quantity proportional to the temperature normalized by a density, which clearly cannot be zero. A second thought rationalization is thet this then requires in the sheath region that there exist only one-sided velocities on the ion distribution. This is reassuring given it is the expectation in this region. If any ion escapes (threshold at $f_i(v_{x_i} \\leq 0$), then this is not the sheath region. However, it is not satisfying that even basic distributions such as Maxwellian ions cannot be captured by this criterion. There is other issue that some authors contest with this rationalization as well (e.g. the kinetic description takes a continuum limit so that $\\lambda_D / L \\rightarrow 0$ so the sheath is infinitely thin), but as concerns the present purposes, it is sufficient to close the controversy survey here given all the main points have been outlined. One bottom line is that the kinetic criterion because of its divergenceless requirement makes the criterion experimentally untestable. The nonlinear Vlasov solver DECSKS-2.0 will provide a check on this criterion, we will see where this condition is of help, thus locating the \"sheath edge.\" "

    "The choice of the potential in the bulk plasma to be at $\\phi = 0$ implies we are interpreting the potential measurements as relative to a non-zero plasma potential. As concerns the potential at the wall, note that we do not have units such that $\\epsilon_0 \\rightarrow 1$ given the above development, hence we elect to choose this at this moment.\n",

    "Note, since the generalized Bohm criterion cannot be checked for distributions with nonempty populations at $v_x = 0$, simulations may be warranted with truncated distributions as boundary conditions may be worth considering so that the numerical results can be directly checked with the Bohm criterion."
