GB3 = 'triple gaussian bell (asymmetric)' which is the test density used in these cases.

The simulation runs were organized as:

edge_cases -- v = 2.1, T = 1.0, a = -0.5, b = 1.5, density is advected through the boundary (v is high enough)

non-edge_cases -- v = 0.5, T, a, b, density all the same. The velocity is small and the density never reaches the boundaries
