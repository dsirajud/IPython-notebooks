    "\n",
    "Linear Landau damping is a basic benchmark for any 1D1V Vlasov solver, and is obtained from Vlasov-Poisson system [1]:\n",

    "$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + v\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + \\frac{qE}{m}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} = -n, \\qquad n = \\int_v dv\\, f(t,x,v)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Without making any explicit assertions at this point, we decompose all quantities $q = \\langle q \\rangle + \\tilde{q}_1 + \\tilde{q}_2 + \\ldots$, so that higher enumerated terms represent the 1, 2, $\\ldots$ order terms that correct the mean value to its observed value. Inserting these models for quantities above, and considering the case wherethere exists no mean field $\\langle E \\rangle = 0$, it is easy to show that the first order equations:\n",

    "$$\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial t} + v\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} + \\frac{qE_1}{m}\\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial v} = 0$$\n",

    "Fourier-Laplace transforming ($\\sim \\exp (ikx - i\\omega t$)) leads to the following constraint:\n",

    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\epsilon (k,\\omega ) = 0, \\quad \\text{where } \\epsilon(k, \\omega ) = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{k^2}\\int dv \\frac{\\partial f_0}{\\partial v}\\frac{1}{v - \\omega / k}$$\n",

    "is the dielectric constant for the (cold) plasma. The integral can be integrated by parts [1], whereupon the boundary term vanishes ($f \\rightarrow 0$ as $x\\rightarrow \\pm\\infty$), leaving an integral $\\sim \\int dv (v - \\omega / k)^{-2}$. For a phase speed $\\omega / k \\gg v$, where $v$ is the peculiar velocity of plasma particles, the term can be expanded in the corresponding small parameter $v / (\\omega / k)$, and retaining (again) only terms up to first order, produces (in the enforced case where $\\text{Im}[\\omega ] \\ll \\text{Re}[\\omega ]$ that [1, p.7],\n",

    "where the common notation $\\omega = \\omega_r + i\\gamma $ has been used to denote real and imaginary parts of the wave frequency. Recall this was derived for the case of the wave speed $\\omega / k$ being much greater than the thermal velocity, hence for physical distriutions we are in a tail of a distribution. If an initial density $f_0$ is known, then this <i>damping constant</i>, $\\text{Im}[\\omega ] \\equiv \\gamma$ can be calculated, which can be observed most physically in the decay in the electric field energy, $W_E = \\frac{\\epsilon_0}{2}|E|^2$.\n",

    "The above linear estimate provides $\\gamma \\simeq 0.153349$. The aim of this notebook is to verify this damping rate is consistent (inasmuch as the linear theory can agree) with the simulation, and to further establish confidence by examining a selection of the infinite invariants the Vlasov-Poisson structure has (note that any Casimir $C = C(f)$ is an invariant, e.g. the set of $L^p$ norms are invariants which are themselves an infinite set). This follows from the solution existing on a Poisson manifold."
