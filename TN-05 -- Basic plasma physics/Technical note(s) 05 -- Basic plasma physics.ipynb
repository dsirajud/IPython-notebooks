    "The Debye length $\\lambda_D$ is an $e$-folding length (or radius) in the electric field strength of a charged particle that develops in plasma systems. Oppositely charged particles within interaction distance of a test charge are influenced by its field and respond to the electrostatic forces accordingly. The net effect is for these particles to aggregate around a test charge so that the electric field is <i>screened out</i> for distances on the order of a Debye length. The plasma remains globally neutral and at zero potential (for length scales $L \\gg \\lambda_D$), yet on length scales comparable to a Debye length ($L \\sim \\lambda_D$) the field of a particle can be detected.\n",

    "The effect can be obtained from considering a test charge $q$ in a plasma with charge density distribution that is produces as a response of this test charge, $\\rho_{resp}$, so that the total charge density is $\\rho (\\vec{x}) = q\\delta (\\vec{x} - \\vec{x}_T) + \\rho_{resp}(\\vec{x})$. We are interested in the pure electrostatic effect of shielding, of which the required information is communicated by Poisson's equation:\n",
