Boundary conditions on the distribution functions, f
================================================================================
 - REQUESTED INPUTS ARE PUT BETWEEN **** rows
 - INFORMATION is put between ---- or ==== rows

 - case insensitive (caps recommended to distinguish inputs from rest of text)
 - options (do not include quotes):

    * 'periodic'
    * 'absorbing' or 'open' or 'cutoff'
    * 'collector' (absorbs all charges that reach boundary and collects them in a total wall charge object)
    * 'symmetric' or 'symmetry' (only available as a lower boundary option)

- The boundary conditions on configuration will need to be compatible with 
  those on the field quantities below (guidance is provided in that section
  in the forenotes)

- consistency is also needed within each set (lower/upper). For example, 
  it does not make sense to have the lower BC be 'periodic' and the upper
  BC to be 'absorbing' as a periodic condition involves both boundaries.

- synonyms are accepted as prescribed above, and are treated identically 
  e.g. ('absorbing' is treated the same as 'open'). The reason for including
  synonyms is for readability and context, e.g. an 'open' system more naturally 
  describes contexts for only tracking velocities within a certain window of a
  larger system, or it might be preferred to take the interpretation that
  we are not tracking velocities after a certain cutoff value, so 'cutoff'
  might be specified be preferred to be specified by the user. In the same context,
  'absorbing' is most natural when considering a condition on a configuration
  variable rather than velocity (e.g. absorbing walls at a certain value x). 
  In other interpretations, an 'open' system might thought to describe both
  configuration and velocity well, e.g. plasma thrusters where density leaves 
  the system, and we only track a certain window of velocities

Boundary conditions on the electric potential, phi

* if on the configuration variable, 'fourier' is chosen as the high order correction
* this section is ignored (unused) and the Fourier Gauss law solver is used
* (periodic boundary conditions)
================================================================================

- 'lower' and 'upper' refer to domain boundaries on abscissas x, y, z

-  if configuration variable is set above to periodic, this section is ignored 
   (a periodic field solver is used along with the corresponding high order method 
    the user indicated, i.e. a fourier solver is used if fourier corrections are
    specified above, and an fd solver is used if fd corrections are specified above)

-  if a variable or value is not used, must denote by 'None' (case sensitive)

keyword options:

    * PERIODIC -- the potential of a periodic plasma is computed. THIS REQUIRES THE BOUNDARY CONDITION
                  ON THE DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION f TO BE 'PERIODIC'

    * BIAS -- the boundary will be held constant at a bias potential phi that is
              is chosen by the user in the BIAS value input section below. Must accompany this by specifying
              the option 'absorbing' on all such x boundaries for the distribution function which have this
              'BIAS' BC on phi.  

    * SELF-CONSISTENT -- the potential at the boundary will be computed self-consistently using
                         the wall charge density history (MUST ALSO SET THE SAME BOUNDARY ON CONFIGURATION
                         VARIABLE TO 'collector' FOR THE DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION). In 1D1V, the charge
                         density is the the total charge. Note: DECSKS does not give precedence to one boundary
                         condition over another (i.e. the phi conditions are not more important than the x
                         boundary conditions on which are on the density). If the BCs for phi and the
                         configuration are not compatible, DECSKS will throw an error and stop the simulation.
                         Example: if 'SELF-CONSISTENT' is set on the upper boundary on phi, but both boundary
                         conditions on x are set to 'periodic', DECSKS will let the user know this happened and
                         stop the simulation.

    * SYMMETRIC or SYMMETRY -- (can only be used on a lower boundary). Indicate this option to treat the domain
                                as having a symmetry line at x = 0. Must also indicate the lower boundary 
                                condition on x as 'symmetric' or 'symmetry' (does not matter which) to stop
                                DECSKS from throwing an error due to incompatible inputs. Example: if
                                'SYMMETRIC' is indicated as the lower boundary condition on phi, but 'absorbing'
                                is selected for the BC on the x configuration variable, an error results and the
                                simulation will stop after notifying the user of why.

GENERAL INFORMATION ON DECISIONS DECSKS MAKES BASED ON USER INPUTS

    we label boundaries below lower/upper, DBC = Dirichlet boundary condition, NBC = Neumann boundary condition

    EXAMPLES

    - PERIODIC/PERIODIC (PBC/PBC)

        lower boundary condition on x = PERIODIC
        upper boundary condition on x = PERIODIC

        * will call the 6th order finite difference Poisson PBC solver. 
        * must be matched with periodic conditions on the distribution function

    - bias/bias (DBC/DBC)

        lower boundary condition on x = BIAS
        upper boundary condition on x = BIAS

        * will call the 6th order finite difference Poisson LDBC_RDBC solver. 
        * will take LDBC as phi = BIAS value
        * will take UDBC as phi = BIAS value as specified in the BIAS VALUE section

    - symmetry/bias (NBC/DBC) -- note: symmetry on the upper boundary is not available

        lower boundary condition on x = SYMMETRY
        upper boundary condition on x = BIAS

        * will call the 6th order finite difference Poisson LNBC_RDBC solver. 
        * will take LNBC as dphi = 0
        * will take UDBC as phi = BIAS value specified in BIAS VALUE section.


    - symmetry/self-consistent (NBC/NBC) : note: symmetry on the upper boundary is not available

                                        Two NBCs are recasted as an equivalent NBC-DBC pair at left boundary,
                                        the value at the upper wall is not enforced but fulfilled automatically
                                        for well-posed problems (e.g. quasineutral systems), the DBC is set
                                        to zero so that the potential at any point x gives the potential
                                        difference directly; in general this is just some reference potential of
                                        our choosing

        lower boundary condition on x = SYMMETRY
        upper boundary condition on x = SELF-CONSISTENT

        * will call the 6th order finite difference Poisson LDBC_LNBC solver.
        * will take LDBC as phi = 0 (reference datum)
        * will take LNBC as dphi = 0 (symmetry condition)
        * these conditions automatically fulfill the self-consistent condition on the UNBC

        ** the specification SELF-CONSISTENT instructs DECSKS to create and track a wall charge density
        history, sim_params['x']['upper'], which is a global variable. The object is not actively used
        but is stored should the user wish to explore its time history

    - self-consistent/self-consistent (NBC/NBC) : 

                                        Two NBCs are recasted as an equivalent NBC-DBC pair at left boundary,
                                        the value at the upper wall is not enforced but fulfilled automatically
                                        for well-posed problems (e.g. quasineutral systems), the DBC is set
                                        to zero so that the potential at any point x gives the potential
                                        difference directly; in general this is just some reference potential of
                                        our choosing. The left NBC is enforced as the self-consistent
                                        potential calculated according to the cumulative charge history sigma, 
                                        which follows from basic electrostatics for a thick conducting wall.

        lower boundary condition on x = SELF-CONSISTENT
        upper boundary condition on x = SELF-CONSISTENT

        * will call the 6th order finite difference Poisson LDBC_LDBC solver
        * will take LDBC as phi = 0 (reference datum)
        * will take LNBC = -sim_params['sigma']['x']['lower'], which is a global variable
        that stores the cumulative charge density history for the lower boundary

        * these conditions automatically fulfill the self-consistent condition on the UNBC
        ** the specification SELF-CONSISTENT instructs DECSKS to create and track a wall charge density
        history, sim_params['x']['upper'], which is a global variable. The object is not actively used
        but is stored should the user wish to explore its time history
