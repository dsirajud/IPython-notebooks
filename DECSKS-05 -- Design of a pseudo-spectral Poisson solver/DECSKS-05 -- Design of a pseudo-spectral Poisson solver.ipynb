    "# B. Goals of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on the design of pseudo-spectral (Fourier-based) solutions of the equations on the right-hand side of the above set. Fourier-based methods operate on globally interpolating functions, giving rise to its well-known convergence and accuracy properties. In [1], a Gauss' law Fourier based method is discussed, we repeat equivalent information (the only difference should be that the reference chooses an asymmetric wave number interval).\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution of the differential equations proceed by electing to differentiate not the function itself (e.g. finite differencing), but instead to differentiate the unique trigonometric interpolation of the function (i.e. the function is projected onto the subspace spanned by complex-valued exponentials in $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$, a <i>Fourier transform</i>) so that differentiation is reduced to algebraic multiplication whereafter the obtained derivative can be mapped back onto $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (<i>inverse Fourier transform</i>). The efficiency of the transform procedure can be reduced to $O(N_x\\log N_x)$ operations for a mesh characterized by $N_x$ grid points, by a divide-and-conquer strategy that recursively groups wave numbers into bins of progressively half the number of wave numbers $N_x$, which constitute the well-known class of algorithms known as the <i>fast Fourier transform (FFT)</i> (e.g. radix-2). Because of the Fourier basis whose basis functions globally interpolate the function, we inherit spectral-like properties and accuracy that is also well-known to be unmatched by any other means."

It should <i>not</i> be assumed that the $\\ell$th component of $\\text{FFT}[\\underline{\\rho}]$ is the $k$th freqency component...it depends on how the transform vector is organized! Different programming languages are equipped with modules that may use different ordering of the Fourier transformed vector, thus it is necessary to learn what organization is used so that the multiplication as in the above does pertain to integration and is not a random product that does not have any meaning (i.e. it is meainingless to compute $\\text{FFT}[\\rho ]_{\\ell} / (\\text{i}\\xi_k)$ for $k \\neq \\ell$). Some languages find it most convenient to put the DC component ($k = 0$) in the center of the actual transform vector, and naturally putting negative frequencies at lower indices (to the left of the center), and positive frequencies to the right (higher indices). Thus, if you are using someone else's FFT routine (as we are, numpy.fft), then it is necessary to find out what kind of result is provided from the function call.  \n",

Then A[1:n/2] contains the positive-frequency terms, and A[n/2+1:] contains the negative-frequency terms, in order of decreasingly negative frequency. For an even number of input points, A[n/2] represents both positive and negative Nyquist frequency, and is also purely real for real input. For an odd number of input points, A[(n-1)/2] contains the largest positive frequency, while A[(n+1)/2] contains the largest negative frequency</i>\"\n",

This sets up the vector $\\underline{\\xi}$ in the same ordering as transform vectors, say $\\text{FFT}[\\underline{\\rho}]$. Thus, this setup makes the $\\ell$th entry in $\\text{FFT}[\\underline{\\rho}]$ agree with the $k$th wave numbers, i.e. $\\ell = k$. This nuance is something that needs to be addressed as it perhaps is the most common way to implement Fourier differentiation/integration incorrectly."
