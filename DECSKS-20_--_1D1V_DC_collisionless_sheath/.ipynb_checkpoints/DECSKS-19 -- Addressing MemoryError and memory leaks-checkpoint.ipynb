    "It is uncertain why Python can still allocate memory more than the maximum 8 GB on this computer, but nonetheless the problem here we wish to emphasize is that we do not need to keep a history of the density functions, <u>we only need to keep the current density and the previous so that the remapping can take place</u>. If we wish to write data to a file we can do that or make plots we can do that from data files or during the simulation, but there is no need to keep an array with a time dimension as we have done. When we move onto simulating time steps in excess of 12,000 steps this will clearly not do. <b>Hence, in this notebook we remove the time entry in the density containers, so that f.shape = (x.N, vx.N), rather than f.shape = (t.N + 1, x.N, vx.N)</b>. This will give us access to longer time problems without having to track down memory leaks and so on. Though this is still of interest and should be looked into at a later date."
