This version of the code was not used for the simulations s17-01 and s17-02, but is instead a cleaned up version (removed notifications inserted to check charge neutrality, and miscellaneous notices printed throughout to provide footprints on where a flag may have been thrown during execution). This should be the same code and work the same, but with the aforementioned removed, and the changeover from the lib.read_DECSKS16 method to renaming it as lib.read (and hence removal of lib.read_DECSKS16 from __init__.py as an import).
